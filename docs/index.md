# Welcome to SPSbot

SPSbot is a simple Discord bot written with [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz)' [`discord.py`](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) framework.

If something's broken, tell me in the [repo](https://github.com/speedstyle/SPSbot/issues/new), the [discord guild](https://discord.gg/UGCbJcM) or - if you have the time, knowledge and inclination - I would be grateful for a [patch](https://github.com/speedstyle/SPSbot).

At present, the bot is not public; it is only available on the aforementioned [discord guild](https://discord.gg/UGCbJcM). A public version will be created when it can do something.

For more information on how to use the bot, see the [commands page](commands). For more information on the backend, see the docs for [`discord.py`](https://discordpy.rtfd.org)
